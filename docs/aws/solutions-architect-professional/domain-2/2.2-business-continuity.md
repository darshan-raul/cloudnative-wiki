# 2.2 Business Continuity

## Resiliency Architectures

### Multi-AZ vs. Multi-Region
*   **Multi-AZ**: Synchronous replication (usually). Protection against data center failure. High Availability (HA).
*   **Multi-Region**: Asynchronous replication. Protection against regional failure. Disaster Recovery (DR).

## Queue and Messaging
*   **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: Decouples components.
    *   *Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)*: Handles failed messages after max retries.
*   **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Pub/Sub. Fan-out to SQS, Lambda, Email.

## Replication

### Database Replication
*   **RDS Read Replicas**: Async. Used for scaling reads. Can be promoted to Primary.
*   **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Sync. Used for HA. Automatic failover.
*   **Aurora Global Database**: Replicates to other regions with latency < 1s. Fast failover.

### Storage Replication
*   **S3 CRR (Cross-Region Replication)**: Copy objects to another region. Requires Versioning.
*   **S3 SRR (Same-Region Replication)**: Copy objects to another bucket in the same region (e.g., Log Aggregation).

> [!WARNING]
> **Exam Gotcha**: S3 Replication is **not retroactive**. It only replicates objects uploaded *after* replication is enabled. To replicate existing objects, you must use **S3 Batch Replication**.
