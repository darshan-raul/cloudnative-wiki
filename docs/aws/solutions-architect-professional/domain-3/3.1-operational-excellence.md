# 3.1 Operational Excellence

## Observability

### CloudWatch (Cheatsheet)
| Feature | Function | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logs** | Centralized logs | App logs, Lambda logs, VPC Flow Logs. |
| **Metrics** | Numerical data points | CPU%, Disk I/O, Custom Metrics. |
| **Alarms** | Triggers based on metrics | Auto Scaling, SNS Notifications. |
| **Events (EventBridge)**| Real-time stream of system events | EC2 State Change -> Lambda. |
| **Contributor Insights** | High cardinality analysis | "Who are top 10 Talkers in VPC Flow Logs?" |
| **Settings** | Configuration | Retention policies. |

### AWS X-Ray
*   **Function**: Distributed Tracing. Visualizes the "Service Map".
*   **Integration**: Works with EC2, ECS, Lambda, API Gateway, SNS, SQS.
*   **Annotations vs Metadata**:
    *   *Annotations*: Indexed, Searchable (e.g., UserID).
    *   *Metadata*: Not indexed, Extra data.

> [!WARNING]
> **Exam Gotcha**: If you need to trace a request across multiple microservices and visualize latency bottlenecks, the answer is **X-Ray**. CloudWatch Logs is for text logs; X-Ray is for traces.

## Automation

### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)
*   **Automation Documents**: JSON/YAML scripts to perform actions (e.g., "Restart instances", "Create snapshot").
*   **Patch Manager**: Automate patching for EC2 and On-prem (Hybrid).
*   **Session Manager**: Secure shell access without opening port 22 or managing keys. Logs to S3/CloudWatch.

### OpsCenter
*   **Function**: Central location to view, investigate, and resolve OpsItems (operational issues) related to AWS resources.
