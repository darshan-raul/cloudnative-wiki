# 3.4 Reliability Improvement

## Failure Management

### Removing Single Points of Failure (SPOF)
*   **Pattern 1**: One EC2 -> ASG with min 2 across AZs.
*   **Pattern 2**: One RDS -> RDS Multi-AZ Standby.
*   **Pattern 3**: Direct Connect -> Direct Connect with VPN Backup or active/active DX.

## Load Balancing
*   **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS). Path/Host routing. WAF integration. Container support (Dynamic ports).
*   **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Layer 4 (TCP/UDP). Ultra-high performance. Static IPs.
*   **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**: Layer 3. Used for firewalls/appliances (GENEVE protocol).

> [!WARNING]
> **Exam Gotcha**: If you need a **Static IP** for your Load Balancer, you must use **NLB**. ALB does *not* support static IPs (its DNS name resolves to changing IPs). If you need WAF, you must use ALB or CloudFront.

## Auto Scaling
*   **Predictive Scaling**: Machine Learning scans history to forecast load and schedule scaling actions *before* the spike.
*   **Warm Pools**: Pre-initialized instances (stopped state) to reduce boot time.
