# 3.5 Cost Optimization Opportunities

## Analysis Tools

### Trusted Advisor
*   **Checks**: Cost Optimization, Performance, Security, Fault Tolerance, Service Limits.
*   **Cost Check**: Identifies "Idle Load Balancers", "Low Utility EC2s", "Unassociated Elastic IPs".
*   **Action**: Provides recommendations but doesn't automatically fix (mostly).

> [!WARNING]
> **Exam Gotcha**: Trusted Advisor checks for **Service Limits** (Quotas) usage (e.g., reaching 80% of limit).

## Billing & Reporting

### Cost and Usage Report (CUR)
*   **Function**: The most detailed billing data available.
*   **Format**: CSV files delivered to S3.
*   **Analysis**:
    *   Use **Athena** to query CUR via SQL.
    *   Use **QuickSight** to visualize CUR data.

### Cost Anomaly Detection
*   **Function**: ML-based detection of unusual spend.
*   **Notification**: SNS/Email alerts.

> [!WARNING]
> **Exam Gotcha**: Cost Explorer is for high-level visual analysis. CUR is for raw, granular data access. If you need to "Programmatically query billing data", thinking CUR + Athena.
